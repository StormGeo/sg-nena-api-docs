- **dk_wind_power.ipynb** - Tutorial on how to plot Danish wind power with data from the Nena API
- **no_hydro_filling.ipynb** - Tutorial on how to plot Norwegian reservoir filling with data from the Nena API

In addition this folder has the python module:

- **nena_api.py** <br>

with pre-implemented python functions for requesting data from the Nena API

### Requirements

You will need the following packages to run the notebook tutorials:

- JupyterLab
- Python3
- Pandas
